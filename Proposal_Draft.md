Landmark Recognition

## Abstract
We present the proposal of building a convolutional network system in attempt to recognize famous landmarks around the world.

## Introduction
While ImageNet attracts a lot of attentions and a lot of models achieves high accuracy, the computer vision area lacks of model to recognizing landmarks. We will be building a convolutional network model using Google-landmarks dataset since it is the largest landmark dataset available. This posts a huge challenge due to the smaller size of the dataset compare to Imagenet, and also the shared features between landmarks that were built in the same era and architectural style. 


## Related Work
With a drastic boom in the deep learning field, this group of algorithms has considerably improved the state of the art in image classification. Some Convolutional Neural Network Architectures can achieve fairly high accuracy on a complicated image dataset. ResNet, for example, successfully obtained a Top-5 classification accuracy on ImageNet. However, compared with traditional image classification with the ImageNet dataset, this Google Landmark Recognition Challenge has some contrasting differences. The number of classes in the Landmark Change is 20 times bigger than the class size of ImageNet, but the size of training examples per class in the given "Google Landmarks" dataset might be quite small. To address these problems, the previous competitor in this challenge tried different combinations of CNN architectures including ResNet50, Inception-ResNet, and SEResNet. The highest accuracy achieved in this year's challenge is about 36% which again indicates a high difficulty level of this classification task.
