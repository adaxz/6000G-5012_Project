## Related Work
With a drastic boom in the deep learning field, this group of algorithms has considerably improved the state of the art in image classification. Some Convolutional Neural Network Architectures can achieve fairly high accuracy on a complicated image dataset. ResNet, for example, successfully obtained a Top-5 classification accuracy on ImageNet. However, compared with traditional image classification with the ImageNet dataset, this Google Landmark Recognition Challenge has some contrasting differences. The number of classes in the Landmark Change is 20 times bigger than the class size of ImageNet, but the size of training examples per class in the given "Google Landmarks" dataset might be quite small. To address these problems, the previous competitor in this challenge tried different combinations of CNN architectures including ResNet50, Inception-ResNet, and SEResNet. The highest accuracy achieved in this year's challenge is about 36% which again indicates a high difficulty level of this classification task.
